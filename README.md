<h1>Applying Filters to SQL Queries</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I used the "AND", "OR", "NOT" and "LIKE" operators to create more complex filters for SQL queries.

<h2>Summary</h2>
I applied filters to SQL queries to get specific information on login attempts and employee machines. I used two different tables: log_in_attempts and employees. I used the "AND", "OR", "LIKE" and "NOT" operators to filter for the specific information needed for each task. I also used "LIKE" and the percentage sign (%) wildcard to filter for patterns, such as login attempts outside of Mexico.</b>
